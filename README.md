# Autonomous Warehouse Forklift Robot

## Project Overview

A fully autonomous warehouse forklift robot designed for small-scale logistics operations. This mechatronics project combines advanced 3D design with sophisticated autonomous navigation and object manipulation capabilities. The project is still undergoing and will be updated with images and code as we progress.

## Key Features

- **Fully Autonomous Operation** - Complete self-navigation and task execution
- **Integrated Forklift System** - Custom 3D-designed lifting mechanism
- **Object Detection & Recognition** - Advanced computer vision for crate identification
- **Warehouse Navigation** - Autonomous movement through warehouse environment
- **Crate Management** - Pickup, transport, and docking of cargo containers
- **Sensor Integration** - Multi-sensor system for environmental awareness

## Technical Implementation

### Hardware
